Yes, the city is the most populated in the country, and yes, many residents pay enough in rent to supply water to a small village. But, the amount of water residents consume is staggering compared to other cities in the United States. Though New York City is far from a drought, water consumption is something city officials and experts have been closely monitoring for years now. 

Interestingly enough though, the cost of water in the city that never sleeps is a subject that is often overlooked. And in one of the cities 5 boroughs, the duality of wealth and poverty can be felt when you turn on the faucet.

In Brooklyn, there are those who pay for their water, and there are those who don’t. Adam, who has lived in Brooklyn for no longer than a few years has struggled with keeping up with water bills.

“I think people overlook the cost of water because they don’t have to worry about those bills…” he says. “My situation is just different I guess…I grew up in Ohio and moved here a few years ago for work. When I was searching for a place to live, there weren’t many options that fit with my financial situation. I chose this place because it was pretty cheap and close to where I work…but the cheaper cost of rent allowed for utilities to be excluded from the monthly rent alone.”

Adam lives in Bedstuy, one of Brooklyn’s many gentrifying neighborhoods, with his dog Emma. The two moved to the neighborhood from Akron, Ohio. Adam was let go from his teaching job only a few months after arriving in New York.

“When I was let go from my job was when I really understood how much cash I was shoveling out for water alone. Even though I was paying utilities before I was fired, it really started to take a toll when my income wasn’t steady…”

With no job and a dog to feed, Adam looked to alternative ways of conserving water to save pennies while searching for new jobs.

“It’s kind of embarrassing but, I started taking less showers at my place and would trick my friends into letting me use theirs. I’ve always been a cheapskate, so…desperate times call for desperate measures I guess. I also started bringing a water bottle around with me everywhere  so I can fill it up throughout the day rather than buying different drinks for myself.”

After job hunting for what seemed to be an eternity, Adam fell upon another teaching opportunity in Williamsburg which payed much higher than the first job he took in Bedstuy. 

“My job now is exactly what I need financially, but I’m still working on those water bills…”.

Adam’s situation is not as unique as you’d think. Though unemployment rates in the city have dropped to a near 3.9%, many people have struggled getting by. Often times, conserving their water usage and finding alternative ways of living on a budget is necessary for keeping a roof over your head, and food in your stomach.

         <p>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIKFpQhVqI4" title="Download movie">In</a> the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, paying for water bills is a new taboo; and for Vanessa, it’s a luxury that goes unnoticed.

“I’ve never payed for water while I’ve been in Brooklyn…or ever for that matter…”, she says.

Vanessa moved here from California for school five years ago. A recent graduate, her parents have been assisting her in paying for rent while she searches for a job in the fashion industry.

“I’ve never really had to think about the cost of water because it has never been separate from the cost of my total rent”, she says. “I didn’t know that people in this city were paying for water though, I assumed that everybody had similar rent situations.” 






Vanessa, like many other wealthy New Yorker’s, has no idea how difficult it is for those without ideal housing contracts to pay for water.

In a study conducted by StreetEasy, it was found that, “Neighborhoods vary less drastically in affordability in Brooklyn and Queens, but the disparity between their asking rents and the typical income is stark, according to the study. That’s because while asking rents may be lower there, the recommended income for apartments still towers over the median household income. For example, the median income for Brooklynites is $55,150, but the recommended income for the borough’s most "affordable" neighborhood, Bensonhurst, is $68,000.”
